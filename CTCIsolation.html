									<h4>Preclinical Imaging Modalities</h4>
									<h5>Small Animal Imaging Systems that Work in Concert</h5>
									<p>TriFoil Imaging provides small animal imaging solutions for pre-clinical and in-vivo studies. TriFoil's small animal imaging system uses biomarkers in small animals to conduct in‐vivo studies of drug metabolism, bioavailability, efficacy and toxicity. These in-vivo images allow researchers to follow a prospective therapy in living animals to see absorption, distribution, metabolism, and toxicology characteristics in real time. The small animal imaging technology improves screening of drug pipeline candidates over classic in‐vitro methods by providing more relevant, consistent biological data with reduced research cost, complexity and time.</p>
									<p><b>TriFoil Imaging provides differentiated, multimodal animal imaging solutions designed for the preclinical market:</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>True 360° Optical tomography</li>
										<li>Sub-mm PET, SPECT and X-Ray CT</li>
										<li>Common platforms for Animal Handling</li>
									</ul>
									<h5>Features & Benefits</h5>		
									<ul>
										<li>Coregistration of Optical, SPECT, CT and PET imaging made easy - All systems use the same animal handling equipment</li>
										<li>Efficiency in your daily research - Modalities can operate simultaneously, so there are no limitations on research workflow</li>
										<li>Truly translational - Transfer preclinical study protocols directly to the clinic</li>
										<li>Wide range of animal models - Accommodates small animals from mice to rats and rabbits</li>
										<li>Upgradable platforms - As your research needs change, upgrade your TriFoil Imaging systems to add throughput and new capabilities for in-vivo small animal imaging</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<div id="InSyTe FLECT">
									<h4>InSyTe FLECT™</h4>
									<p><b>True 360° Tomographic Optical Preclinical Imaging</b></p>
									<p>With the FLECT system, TriFoil enables researchers to realize the full potential of in vivo optical imaging for small animals.FLECT allows researchers to capture true 3D tomographic images by acquiring projection images 360° around the animal subject and sequent accurate image reconstruction. With the FLECT system, researchers will no longer have to choose between imaging only near the surface of the animal subject and partial tomography solutions that distort the subject or create artifacts. Instead, the FLECT provides uniform sensitivity and resolution throughout the animal subject. For the first time, researchers will be able to examine deep tissue phenomena such as spontaneous metastases without sacrificing image quality or quantitative accuracy.</p>
									<p>With the optional upgrade of an integrated, inline X-ray CT, researchers will gain anatomical correlation data that will significantly improve the segmentation and resolution of the optical images. Our InSyTe FLECT/CT™ system automatically co-registers the optical and CT images for better anatomical correlation.</p>
									<p>FLECT (Fluorescence Emission Computed Tomography) reconstructs the 3D tomographic images from the photon emission data acquired 360° around the animal subject (projection images) using a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction engine based on an accurate model of light propagation in biological tissue. The result is the most accurate optical quantitation available.</p>
									<p>The FLECT laser excites the fluorophore inside the animal subject, causing the fluorophore to emit light at a different wavelength, or fluorescence. The fluorescence is recorded by an array of detectors around the animal subject. Then the gantry rotates, changing the position of the laser and detectors, for acquiring data at a different angle. This process is repeated again and again until the subject has been imaged at all angles covering 360° for each individual slice. The animal bed is then moved to the next slice position so that the animal subject can be imaged along its entire body.</p>

								<div id="InSyTe PET">
									<h4>reclinical Benchtop InSyTe PET/CT</h4>
									<p><b>The first High Performance PET benchtop system with in-line X-ray CT</b></p>
									<p>The LabPET sub-system provides you with the ability to visualize and quantify biological processes over a wide range of PET tracer activities with a reconstructed isotropic image resolution of <1.0µl (<1mm).The InSyTe LabPET system is the first preclinical PET with continuous bed motion PET detection. This so-called continuous-motion PET maintains uniform signal-to-noise sensitivity across the entire scan range. This capability combined with TriFoil's digital APD-based PET expands its proven in-plane quantitative accuracy to precise quantifiable results in all dimensions. </p>
									<h5>Other features include:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Field-of View (FOV): 11cm bore size with selectable transverse FOV of 25mm to 65mm, all with user selectable continuous-motion scanning over an axial FOV of up to 150mm.</li>
										<li>Continuous-motion PET with list-mode acquisitions for high post-processing and reconstruction flexibility, including decay, scatter and CT-based attenuation corrections.</li>
										<li>Reconstruction algorithms include FBP, 2D-MLEM, 3D-MLEM and fast, patent-protected 3D AMPS-OSEM algorithm</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The digital PET advantage:Through direct one-to-one coupling of scintillators to APD detectors, light sharing between crystal pixels and detectors can be avoided, leading to improved spatial contrast resolution. In addition, since the system employs parallel processing of the detector signals, saturation of detection and counting electronics can be avoided which results in a largely expanded quantitation range.
									Customers will also have the option of installing the in-line CT to their benchtop system either at initial purchase or as an upgrade.  The Computed Tomography (CT) sub-system provides high-quality CT images. Its co-axial design with PET enables one-pass imaging with automatic co-registration of functional and anatomical images. The CT system features a large-area 1.3 mega pixel CMOS detector and 50W X-ray source, optimized for soft-tissue contrast imaging. It has the flexibility to perform a wide range of acquisition protocols, with whole-body imaging in less than 90 seconds.</p>
								</div>	
								<div id="InSyTe SPECT">
									<h4>Preclinical Benchtop InSyTe SPECT/CT</h4>
									<p><b>The first benchtop SPECT system with MMP-SPECT™</b></p>
									<p>The MMP-SPECT sub-system exploits the proven performance of Multiplexed Multi-Pinhole SPECT (MMP-SPECT) and the high intrinsic spatial and energy resolutions of the solid-state Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detector technology. Direct CZT detection eliminates scintillator light-spreading and PMT light-sharing. This enables simultaneous pinhole projection of up to 16 images on a single detector.</p>
									<p>The InSyTe SPECT sub-system is designed to perform both focused and whole-body SPECT imaging, as well as static and dynamic SPECT acquisitions.</p>
									<p><b>Other features include:</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>Is configured with two CZT digital gamma cameras of high intrinsic 1.6 mm resolution.</li>
										<li>Multi-pinhole collimators with up to 16 pinholes per detector for mice and small rats.</li>
										<li>High energy resolution (better than 4.5 % at 140 keV) generates clear images by reducing radiation scatter, and is uniquely suited for simultaneous multi-isotope imaging.</li>
										<li>Single- and multi-isotope detection of all common SPECT isotopes: I-125, 99mTc, I-123, In-111, Lu-177, Re-188, etc.</li>
										<li>Patent-protected HiSPECT 3D-OSEM image reconstruction with RAYguide contrast enhancement for low-dose images</li>
									</ul>
									<h5>The Digital SPECT Advantage illustrated:</h5>
									<p>Overlapping projections are enabling InSyTe's SPECT system to cover the entire diameter of the animal with one single acquisition, thus avoiding numerous step-and-shoot system operations for whole-body scanning.</p>
								</div>	
								<div id="InSyTe SPECT">
									<h4>InSyTe Benchtop CT</h4>
									<p><b>The first in-line X-ray CT series available with either a FLECT, PET or SPECT</b></p>
									<p>The InSyTE X-Ray Only (XO) Computed Tomography (CT) system provides high-quality CT images. Its co-axial design with PET, SPECT or FLECT enables one-pass imaging with automatic co-registration of functional and anatomical images. When used for standalone X-ray CT, images can be fused with tomographic images from other systems imported through DICOM. The CT system features a large-area 1.3 mega pixel CMOS detector and 50W X-ray source, optimized for soft-tissue contrast imaging. It has the flexibility to perform a wide range of acquisition protocols, with whole-body imaging in less than 90 seconds.</p>
									<p>The InSyTe CT can be installed with FLECT, PET or SPECT or later upgraded at the user's facility.</p>
