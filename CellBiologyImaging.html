The INKREDIBLE+ is a pneumatic-based extrusion bioprinter with dual printheads and UV LED curing system for bioprinting of complex human tissue models and organs for tissue engineering research. Furthermore, the INKREDIBLE+ also contains a system for heating the cartridges, allowing for even more diverse uses in bioprinting. CELLINK's patented Clean Chamber Technology allows the INKREDIBLE+ to be operated outside of a biological hood – making it a true benchtop 3D bioprinter!

										<p class="prodtext">The INKREDIBLE 3D bioprinter is a pneumatic-based extrusion bioprinter with dual print heads and UV LED curing system for bioprinting of complex human tissue models and organs for tissue engineering research. It is a cost-effective unit for innovators to enter the 3D bioprinting field and start bioprinting living tissues at ease. The INKREDIBLE series bioprinters can be used as standalone units thanks to the LCD controller or they can be monitored through a computer with the use of the accompanied software. Your three-dimensional design files are translated into coordinates and instructions for the INKREDIBLE which allows the bioprinter to move according to a defined path. The bioprinting process works through the extrusion of a bioink or hydrogel biomaterial combined with human cells in a bottom-up, layer-by-layer fashion until a 3D construct is built. Once the construct has been bioprinted, it is crosslinked using the UV LED curing system or ionic solutions, depending on your bioink’s crosslinking requirements.<br/>&nbsp;</p>

										<p class="prodtext">With the NyONE® cell imager the Trypan Blue assay can be carried out as whole-well measurements in 96 well microplates with significantly increasing throughput (5 minutes per 96 samples), reducing the time-to-result and requiring smaller sample volumes (20 µl in total) compared to other existing assay formats<br/>&nbsp;</p>
