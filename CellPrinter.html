										<h4 class="prodhead">The working principle in words and pictures<br/>&nbsp;</h4>
										<p class="prodtext">Welcome to the technical page. Here we show you how our technology works in principle.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
										<p class="prodtext">Our technology is based on an inkjet-like principle. We generate tiny, free-flying droplets from a microfluidic chip (1). Inside this chip (which is part of our dispensing cartridge) your sample cells (2) are stored. The system works as a direct displacement dispenser. Meaning, we can generate a droplet whenever we want to. Experts call this drop-on-demand. We use a microscope objective and a camera to look into the chip, directly at your cells. We take an image from them in the nozzle. The nozzle is the lower part of the chip where droplets are ejected from.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
										<p class="prodtext">Once we have taken the image, a super-fast image processing algorithm detects all cells in this image. It counts and classifies them along morphological criteria like size and roundness. Then a droplet is generated and all what is inside the nozzle is ejected in this droplet. So we can't control what the droplets contain, but we know it.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
										<p class="prodtext">To sort the droplets we use a pneumatic shutter system (3). It is located directly underneath the nozzle. When we generate a droplet (4) that contains a single-cell we let this specific droplet pass onto your substrate (5). All droplets being generated that do not contain one cell (void droplets and those with multiple cells) are taken off by the shutter into waste.<br/>&nbsp;</p>

											<p class="prodtext">&nbsp;<br/><b> Details f.sight®	</b></p>
											<p class="prodtext">The f.sight® dispenses both unlabeled and fluorescent cells with the highest efficiency. The novel dual camera system allows you to capture bright field and fluorescence information simultaneously at full resolution.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
											<p class="prodtext">Both cameras can be controlled independently and the built-in powerful blue laser is freely adjustable. Together, their high dynamic range allows you to visualize even the weakest fluorophores. You want to use fluorescent dyes to label your products right in or on the cells producing them? Not a problem, the f.sight® can visualize them, even when there is only few of them.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
											<p class="prodtext">You also want to process non-fluorescent cells? That's ok, just switch off the laser and use the f.sight's® bright field sorting mode. Just like with its small brother - the c.sight® - cells can then be sorted by morphological criteria.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
											<p class="prodtext">Use your standard dyes like GFP, FITC, Calcein AM, CellTracker Green, and others. Thanks to the non-transparent flap, your dyes and cells are ideally protected from ambient light during the process. Afraid of bleaching or phototoxic effects by the laser? You don't have to. The laser spot is only illuminating the nozzle. Laser intensity can be freely adjusted. If you run sensitive dyes, reduce the laser intensity and increase the cameras exposure time instead to keep your sample safe.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
											<p class="prodtext">Our all new software is fast and intuitive. Design your individual fluorescence experiments within minutes. Full-resolution bright field and fluorescence images separately plus an overlay image are all recorded and saved for future analysis and for assurance of clonality.<br/>&nbsp;</p>

										<p class="prodtext"><b>Bioprint without compromising biology.</b></p>
										<p class="prodtext">Allevi 3D bioprinters are engineered to handle the widest range of bioinks. Users can easily control conditions that are optimal for the most relevant materials used in tissue engineering. We’re designed to fit your needs and to fit within your existing workflow.<br/>&nbsp;</p></section>										
										<p class="prodtext"><b>Rigorously tested bioinks.</b></p>
										<p class="prodtext">The bioinks we offer have been thoroughly tested by us, academia, and the tissue engineering industry as a whole, and have been proven to yield the best biological results. These are materials you are used to, such as collagen and hyaluronic acid. No need to start from scratch.<br/>&nbsp;</p></section>

				<p>The Slit Slider is a slideshow with a twist: the idea is to slice open the current slide when navigating to the next or previous one. Using jQuery and CSS animations we can create unique slide transitions for the content elements. </p>
